## Intro
 The generator creates a webpage with employee id, name, email, and employee specific parameter quickly through the terminal. This application is ideal for Human Resources employees who need to create a visual represenation of the employees at the company.

## My Employee Generator
The generator runs in the terminal by using "node app.js". It uses a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Node.js/packages. The questions are prompted using inquirer. The app will prompt the user in filling out manager information, then are promted with choices (engineer, intern, or i dont want any more employees). When all the employee's information has been satisfied, the user can end the app by selecting "I dont want any more employees". This will create a team.html file in the output foler and will create a webpage with all the employee information on cards.
